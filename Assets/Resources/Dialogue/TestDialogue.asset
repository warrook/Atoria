  Speaker: Prophecy
  Text: It shall be on the day that the world turns to summer, a child in red shall
    cause an aeon of fortune and the destruction of nature. Upon the day white smoke
    rises, a woman of grey shall bring forth a time of prosperity and a destruction
    of power. When siblings rival, a drunk shall bring forth a country's new rise
    and an age of inhumanity. It shall be then, when summer ends, a suspicious death
    shall bring forth technological advancement.
